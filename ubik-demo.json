The walls are adorned with vibrant, geometric patterns, while a fluorescent orange shag carpet covers the floor. Sun rays filter through the room, reflecting off the chrome accents of the myriad of automatic appliances lining the walls. From the coin-operated coffee machine to the self-cleaning shower, every aspect of the apartment begs for a handful of coins to activate its mechanical wonders. Ironically, Joe stands in the center of his technologically advanced domain, empty pockets jingling with nothing but the reminder of his financial hardship.\n\n\n\n"

As her fingers dance through the invisible interface, the scenery behind her transforms in real-time, shifting and morphing with each keystroke. Walls bend and twist, objects disappear and reappear, and time itself seems to stutter. The audience watches in awe as Pat Conley, the master of reality manipulation, seamlessly re-edits the very fabric of their perceptions.\n\n\n"
