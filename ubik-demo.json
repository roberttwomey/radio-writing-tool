From the coin-operated coffee machine to the self-cleaning shower, every aspect of the apartment begs for a handful of coins to activate its mechanical wonders.

As her fingers dance through the invisible interface, the scenery behind her transforms in real-time, shifting and morphing with each keystroke.
